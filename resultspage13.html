         <h2>Congratulations! The Duckhorse represents one of the most mesmerizing, unique personalities (yes, this is the output for everybody else as well. WE ARE ALL UNIQUE!) for after all it is a mixture between one of the  ost majestic animals - the horse - and one of the silliest but cutest ones - the duck. And it makes perfect sense that you'd be a Duckhorse if you think about it!
           You are a diurnal animal (extrovert), you are normally not a pet (you like clubbing), you are sporty and you chose the veg meal...So, what other than a Duckhorse could you possibly be?</h2>
