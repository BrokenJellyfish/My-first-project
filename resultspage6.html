         <h2>Congratulations! The Chimphog represents one of the most mesmerizing, unique personalities (yes, this is the output for everybody else as well. WE ARE ALL UNIQUE!) for after all it is a mixture between two of the cutest animals on earth: the baby hedgehog and a baby chimpanzee. And it makes perfect sense that you'd be a Chimphog if you think about it!
           You are a nocturnal animal (introvert), you are a dog person (so you can't be a cat), most people like you right away, just like they love elephants and koalas, and you also consider yourself immature...So, what other than a Chimphog could you possibly be?</h2>
