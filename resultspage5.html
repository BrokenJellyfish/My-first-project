         <h2>Congratulations! The Koalaphant represents one of the most mesmerizing, unique personalities (yes, this is the output for everybody else as well. WE ARE ALL UNIQUE!) for after all it is a mixture between one of the slowest animals on earth - the elephant and one of the mentally slowest animals on earth (because they are constantly high on Eucalyptus) - the koala. And it makes perfect sense that you'd be a Koalaphant if you think about it!
           You are a nocturnal animal (introvert), you are a dog person (so you can't be a cat), most people like you right away, just like they love elephants and koalas, and you also consider yourself mature, hence you get a long lieftime just like the elephants...So, what other than a Koalaphant could you possibly be?</h2>
