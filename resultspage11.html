         <h2>Congratulations! The Dobercrow represents one of the most mesmerizing, unique personalities (yes, this is the output for everybody else as well. WE ARE ALL UNIQUE!) for after all it is a mixture between one of the fittest dogs - the dobermann - and one othe fittest birds - the crow. And it makes perfect sense that you'd be a Dobercrow if you think about it!
           You are a diurnal animal (extrovert), you are a pet (you like houseparties), you are a dog person (so you even get to be half dog) and you are an attacker...So, what other than a Dobercrow could you possibly be?</h2>
