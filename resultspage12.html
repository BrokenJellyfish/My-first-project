         <h2>Congratulations! The Mohuahua represents one of the most mesmerizing, unique personalities (yes, this is the output for everybody else as well. WE ARE ALL UNIQUE!) for after all it is a mixture between one of the funniest (and smallest) dogs - the Chihuahua - and one tinniest animals - the mouse. And it makes perfect sense that you'd be a Mohuahua if you think about it!
           You are a diurnal animal (extrovert), you are a pet (you like houseparties), you are a dog person (so you even get to be half dog) and you are not an attacker...So, what other than a Mohuahua could you possibly be?</h2>
