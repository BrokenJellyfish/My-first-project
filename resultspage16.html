         <h2>Congratulations! The Butterphant represents one of the most mesmerizing, unique personalities (yes, this is the output for everybody else as well. WE ARE ALL UNIQUE!) for after all it is a mixture between one of the biggest and slowest animas and one of the tiniest and...well, still not very fast ones. And it makes perfect sense that you'd be a Butterphant if you think about it!
           You are a diurnal animal (extrovert), you are normally not a pet (you prefer partying outside), you aren't sporty and you are not an attacker...So, what other than a Butterphant could you possibly be?</h2>
